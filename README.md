[Link to live site](https://hebaulf.github.io/poster/)

As a second project at in Vefsk√≥li, I recreated this poster from [swissted.com](https://www.swissted.com/products/radiohead-at-the-warfield-1997) using HTML and CSS.
I added some motion with css animation and hover effects top funk it up a bit and media queries to make it scalable to mobile.

Hope you like it!
